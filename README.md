# Robotics-Circuit-Python
This repo covers the instructions to get started using CircuitPython for robotics.


First steps:
1. Buy the parts from this [link](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists?wid=594214).
2. 3D print the files from my [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/20b7209d5a808e16138f0bd3/w/ffd99e6b2a22d8d531efdfad/e/a709acf4e6ed8e770ab56ab0) account.
3. Update the Maker Pi RP2040 software. Here's the [link](https://circuitpython.org/board/cytron_maker_pi_rp2040/).
4. Update the QT Py ESP32-S3 softare. Here's the [link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3/circuitpython-2) for the instructions.
5. Download the Circuit Python Bundle for Version 9.X. Here's the [link](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
6. Assemble all of the electronics and 3D printed parts. You might find [standoffs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y5TJXY1?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and [heatset insterts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B47MZ1SG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) useful.
8. Cut and solder the wires for the motor encoders.
9. Cut and solder the wires for the QT Py ESP32-S3.
10. With the microcontrollers plugged in, drag and drop the files in MAKER-PI and ESP32-S3 to the respective microcontroller.
11. Download Bluefruit Connect on your phone from the app store.
