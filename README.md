# Robotics-Circuit-Python
This repo covers the instructions to get started using CircuitPython for robotics.


First steps:
1. Buy the parts from this [link](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists?wid=594214).
2. 3D print the files from my [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/20b7209d5a808e16138f0bd3/w/ffd99e6b2a22d8d531efdfad/e/a709acf4e6ed8e770ab56ab0) account.
3. Update the Maker Pi RP2040 software. Here's the [link](https://circuitpython.org/board/cytron_maker_pi_rp2040/).
4. Download the Circuit Python Bundle for Version 9.X. Here's the [link](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
5. Assemble all of the electronics and 3D printed parts.
6. Cut and solder the wires for the motor encoders.
